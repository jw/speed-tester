This script runs a network connection speed test and sends the results to a monitor
(see the `speed-monitor` project for this).  The `host` and `port` of the monitor
need to be provided; while the `logfile` is optional (by default it is `./speed-tester.log`).

A `crontab` scheduler is also provided.
